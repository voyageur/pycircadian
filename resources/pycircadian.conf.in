# Whether TTY input on *any* TTY blocks idle. This includes X terminals,

# Default: true

# Whether X11 idle detection is used, the specifics of which are determined
# by your particular combination of window/display manager. This is normally

# by certain programs. Typically, any program that prevents the screensaver
# from displaying will also reset this.

# Whether active SSH connections block the system from being idle. Both
# inbound and outbound connections will prevent the system from going idle
# if enabled.

# Default: true

# Whether active Samba connections block the system from being idle. Note
# that GVfs sometimes makes local loopback connections to a local Samba
# share, which will prevent idle. This is disabled by default because of
# the aggressiveness of SMB browsing clients.

# systemcl action called when the system is determined to have been idle
